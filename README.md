Welcome to the trial 

Add some small solutions to the code or/and add some comments where you think improvements can be made.

This test should take you no more than 30 minutes.

Using AI is not allowed.

##### Changes I propose
1. we initially imported a whole module ```requests``` instead of the method we needed, ```request.RequestException```... it makes our code slower. our import statement in main.py should have been ```from requests import RequestException```
2. I also saw problems with inconsistent indentation using spaces and tabs. Using Pycharm, an IDE dedicated to python helped me format the code properly by pressing ```Ctrl+Alt+L```.
3. I have added the proposed solutions to the code as comments
