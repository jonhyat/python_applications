Welcome to the trial 

Add some small solutions to the code or/and add some comments where you think improvements can be made.

This test should take you no more than 30 minutes.

##### Changes I propose
1. I preferred to use getLogger instead of Logger in my solution because the method ```getLogger(__name__)``` is looks for any existing logger configurations for the given name while the ```Logger(__name__)``` is creating a default logger with the name and sets the default log level to 0.
2. I also saw problems with inconsistent indentation using spaces and tabs. Using Pycharm, an IDE dedicated to python helped me format the code properly by pressing ```Ctrl+Alt+L```. I used spaces since they are more recommended for code readability.
3. I have added the proposed solutions to the code as comments
